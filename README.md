Simulation code for Trade Leakage and Design of a Carbon Tax (Weisbach, Kortum, Wang, Yao 2022).

The code used to generate simluation results and figures can be found in the folder "codes".

Simulation results are stored in "output". output_case3 has equal elasiticity of energy supply (0.5) while output_case3_D_2 has home elasticity = 0.5 and foreign elasiticty = 2.
